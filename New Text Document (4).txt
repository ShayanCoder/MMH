Great — with 17 years of experience, strong engineering background, and 120 hours total prep time (1–3 months), you don’t need a beginner plan.
You need a high-efficiency, pattern-focused plan aimed at FAANG & top-tier interviews.
Below is a complete 120-hour LeetCode + System Design + Behavioral study plan, optimized for senior-level roles.

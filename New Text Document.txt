Advanced Scenario-Based Questions (Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, AWS)
For 15–20 yrs experience (Principal / Staff / Senior Engineer)
🔥 1. Distributed Systems & Messaging
1.1 ECS-deployed consumers reading from SQS/Kafka — how to avoid duplicate message processing?
Hints:
SQS: deduplication, message visibility timeout, idempotency keys, distributed locks?
Kafka: consumer groups, partition assignment, idempotent producers, transactions, offset commits.
1.2 How do you ensure exactly-once semantics in a microservice reading from Kafka → DB → publish to another topic?
Hints:
Outbox pattern, local transactions, Kafka transactions, Debezium CDC.
1.3 Your microservice processes payments. ECS scales up to 20 tasks. How do you guarantee ordering of events per user?
1.4 What happens if two ECS tasks pick the same SQS message due to visibility timeout expiry? How do you prevent side effects?
1.5 How to design an "idempotent API" when backend operations are not naturally idempotent?
🔥 2. High-Scale Architecture & Microservices
2.1 How would you design per-user rate limiting in a distributed microservices architecture deployed across multiple ECS tasks?
Hints:
Token bucket in Redis / DynamoDB
Distributed counters
API Gateway throttling vs application-side throttling
Sliding window log vs leaky bucket
Client-level vs system-level
2.2 How would you design a "global lock" across microservices to avoid concurrent modification of a resource?
2.3 How do you design a microservice that must handle 100k RPS with <10 ms latency?
2.4 How to design a distributed cron job when your service runs in 12 ECS tasks and only one must run the job?
2.5 You have a microservice that becomes slow due to dependency service latency. How do you isolate and protect your service?
Hints:
Bulkhead pattern
Circuit breaker
Timeouts & retries
Fallbacks
Backpressure
🔥 3. Spring Boot / Spring Cloud Advanced
3.1 Why do thread pools cause hidden performance issues in reactive Spring applications?
3.2 How do you debug Spring Boot memory leak in production (ECS)?
Hints:
Heap dump via ECS Exec
MAT / JFR / JMC
Leaking class loaders
Caching mistakes
3.3 How would you write a Spring Boot interceptor that caches responses per user with TTL and invalidation rules?
3.4 Explain how Spring handles transactions across multiple threads or async boundaries.
3.5 You have a service that publishes an event only after a DB commit succeeds. How to guarantee this?
Hints:
TransactionSynchronizationManager
Outbox pattern
@Transactional pitfalls
🔥 4. Java Concurrency & Performance
4.1 You have 1M tasks to process. Should you use ThreadPoolExecutor or virtual threads? Why?
4.2 How do you detect and prevent thread starvation deadlocks in Java?
4.3 Explain differences between synchronized, ReentrantLock, StampedLock, ReadWriteLock with practical scenarios.
4.4 How does Java handle false sharing? How to avoid it?
4.5 How do you optimize a high-GC-rate application?
Hints:
G1 tuning
Allocation profiling
Escape analysis
Memory leak detection
🔥 5. AWS Architecture & Cloud-native
5.1 How do you implement multi-AZ failover for a microservice using RDS + ECS + ALB?
5.2 Your Lambda function is getting throttled due to concurrency limits. How do you fix it?
5.3 How do you design a secure system for storing customer PII on AWS?
Hints:
KMS
Envelope encryption
DynamoDB TTL
IAM boundary policies
5.4 How do you handle distributed caching in AWS in high throughput services?
Hints:
ElastiCache
DAX
DynamoDB with caching layers
Global cache invalidations
5.5 How to implement a blue-green or canary deployment in ECS with zero downtime?
🔥 6. Databases, Transactions, Consistency
6.1 How do you design a system that must ensure no two users can reserve the same seat in an event?
Hints:
Optimistic locking
Compare-and-swap
Distributed locks
Idempotency
6.2 How do you handle long-running transactions (>2 seconds) in microservices?
6.3 How do you design read replicas safely when reading stale data can break business rules?
6.4 You have a high-write DynamoDB table. How do you avoid hot partitions?
🔥 7. Security & Resilience
7.1 How would you secure inter-service communication inside a VPC?
7.2 How do you detect and prevent replay attacks in your REST APIs?
7.3 How do you design a zero-trust microservices architecture using Spring Security?
7.4 How do you implement request signing (like AWS SigV4) in your own services?
🔥 8. Complex Scenario Design / Architecture Questions
8.1 Design a globally distributed user-notification system (email + SMS + push) with retries, deduplication, and user-specific throttling.
8.2 Design a payment system that must be strongly consistent but also high-availability. What trade-offs will you make?
8.3 Design a microservice for large-file uploads (2–5 GB) that must support resumable uploads.
8.4 Design an order-processing system with eventual consistency, but users must not see inconsistent order states.
8.5 Design a real-time analytics dashboard that ingests 500k events/sec.
